    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook performs exploratory data analysis on the processed dataset to better understand the engineered features created during the ETL stage. It combines statistical hypothesis testing and graphical exploration to identify meaningful patterns, validate assumptions, and confirm relationships relevant to stress detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights from this analysis will provide a deeper understanding of feature significance, support model development, and inform the design of visual elements in the Streamlit dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests for the following hypotheses compare three stress groups (Low, Medium, High) using non-parametric tests (data that is skewed, contains outliers, or is better described by ranks or medians rather than means). For this reason, I use the Kruskal-Wallis H test (which is ideally suited to this scenario with 3+ groups):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H1:** Lower sleep duration is linked to higher stress.\n",
    "- **H2:** Lower sleep quality is linked to higher stress.\n",
    "- **H5:** Higher physical activity is linked to lower stress.\n",
    "- **H6:** Higher caffeine intake is linked to higher stress.\n",
    "- **H7:** Longer work hours and longer travel time are linked to higher stress.\n",
    "- **H8:** Health indicators differ across stress groups (BP, cholesterol, blood sugar).\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, the Chi-square test of independence is used for the following hypotheses, as they involve categorical variables and assess whether there is a significant association between stress levels and different lifestyle characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-square test is appropriate when comparing frequency counts across categories (e.g., meditates vs does not meditate, exercise type). It evaluates whether observed differences between groups are likely due to chance or reflect a genuine relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Chi-square test results show contingency tables with very small expected cell counts (typically fewer than 5), the Fisher's Exact Test is also conducted, as it provides a more reliable result for small samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses tested with Chi-square (and Fisher's Exact if needed):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **H3:** Higher screen time is linked to higher stress.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Findings:** [To be interpreted after running the notebook with actual data]\n",
    "    - The Chi-square test indicates whether meditation practice is significantly associated with stress level distribution.\n",
    "    - Cramér's V indicates the strength of the association.\n",
    "    - The stacked bar chart visually shows the difference in stress proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support for H4:** \n",
    "    - If p < 0.05 and meditators show a higher proportion of Low stress (or lower proportion of High stress), H4 is supported.\n",
    "    - The effect size indicates whether this is a meaningful practical difference.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - Meditation_Practice should be considered as a feature in the predictive model.\n",
    "    - This binary feature may be particularly useful given its interpretability.\n",
    "    - May interact with other lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, exercise type)."
